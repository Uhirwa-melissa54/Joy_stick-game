# Arduino Joystick Game

This project connects an **Arduino joystick** to a game built in **Python**, allowing you to control the game using physical joystick movements.

### Project Files
- **README.md** – Overview and instructions for the project.  
- **Arduino_code/joystick_reader.ino** – Arduino sketch for reading joystick input.  
- **joystick-game-using-pygame.py** – Game implemented with Pygame.  
- **joystick-game-using-opengl.py** – Game implemented with OpenGL.  

### About
The Arduino reads the joystick’s X and Y movements and sends them to the Python game via serial communication. This demonstrates how to integrate hardware and software to create an interactive game experience.
